# Packaging-Industry-Influencing-Sales-Brand-Image-and-Customer-Base

<h3>Introduction</h3><br>
While they say don’t judge a book by its cover, the cover plays quite a crucial role in today’s economy and market for the success of any product. Successful businesses and brands stand by protecting their name, fame and brand with their packaging. First impressions are crucial and a product’s packaging is the first introduction of a customer to the product. Packaging isn’t supposed to be an obstacle or tedious work for people but rather a beautiful experience of unpacking any product. Attractive packaging brings along with it an aura of intrigue and is the best opportunity for a company to make a good sale. Carrying the product identity, it is the packaging that helps us compare, remember and associate, when we have hundreds of options in front of us. <br><br>
The human brain works by associating and classifying. For customers to associate with a product and its ad/marketing, various factors such as packaging color, layout, material, size and shape and other design elements like elegance and simplicity have to be considered before product launch/sale. In many of the cases, better and appropriate packaging can trigger the basis for customer loyalty and change brand perception. <br><br>
The advertisement and marketing industry is on the rise from the last two decades. Amongst many factors that affect the sales of a product, the packaging is tangible and is preliminary. Attractive packaging is used to draw attention in customers and increase the probability of sales. This form of marketing has given birth to various innovative ideas. It’s a method of reflecting the quality, creativity, and authenticity of a brand. <br><br>
In the earlier times, it was just a necessity for protection of product and no one paid attention to branding as there was an assumption of customers having no expectations. Companies just considered packaging as an afterthought but when they spend so much time perfecting the product, packaging needs equal attention. With changing times, packaging has taken a vital role in the development of any company and its marketing strategies. It has led to the emergence of an entirely separate packaging industry.

<h3>Abstract</h3><br>
Statistical results show that about 70% of users see packaging as the first thing while making a buying decision. It is natural that if the packaging is sloppy, the consumer will look for a substitute. Luxury goods that come in intricate designs of packaging are better sold, especially amongst younger generations and the class of bloggers. There’s a section of customers who make an educational choice when purchasing any product by considering the environmental damage, economical factors and other technical advancements in the product packaging. However, many are ignorant of these elements and factors. Environmental factors are often ignored and a lot of customers are also unaware of the latest innovations and technological aspects of packaging such as tamper-evident packaging and QR codes.  <br>
Before any product sale, the mindset of the target section needs to be studied which will greatly influence the design of the packaging and resources required. A simple survey can reveal how customer loyalty can be triggered and broken by the new product while simultaneously, educating them. Resource allocation needs to be focused on subsets of individuals rather than a whole class of people as income, age and personal choices play an important role. <br>
Analysis of the trends in the packaging industry is a study to understand the mindset, expectations and suggestions of the customers and target market for better branding of the company, more sales in a competitive marketplace and widening loyal customer base. <br>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3><br>
Various elements influence the decision behind a particular packaging, in terms of design, layout, colour, size, shape, material and even content on packaging. <br>
The main features of good packaging are: <br>
1.	Convenient to transport, handle and open. <br>
2.	Attractive to catch the attention in first glance and intrigue the customer to check it. <br>
3.	Economical with decent cost price in regard with the resources used for the packaging.  <br>
4.	Protection for the product is a must and is the primary purpose. <br>
5.	Communicative by providing all the necessary information about the product to the customer and should act like a silent salesman. <br>
Studies show that packaging of products can increase customer satisfaction, increase visibility and set one product apart from its competition. The analysis study will showcase the factors most important for the customers and the expectations they have in terms of different elements. <br>

<h3>Objective and Proposed System</h3>
The objective is to study, scrutinize, and analyze the survey results for a deeper understanding of consumer purchasing behaviors with respect to packaging. Various factors such as design, cost, product protection, technology, sustainability, and authenticity are covered by the questions in the survey. The aim is to gain insights into how product packaging affects the sales of a product. <br>
1.	In the proposed system, we are going to use the data collected from the survey to analyze and derive insights on the various influential factors customers act upon. We will preprocess the database to get reliable and accurate patterns and insights and use descriptive statistics to draw conclusions such as – major factors for purchase, ranking of packaging elements, categories of the packaging, technical and informative details on packaging. <br>
2.	Using EDA, we will show the trend of the growth of packaging in the world and how it expanded and customised. Using graphs, we study how one factor behind packaging is interrelated to the other. <br>
3.	We also do predictive analytics as to what the magnitude of the packaging trends can be in the future years. <br>

<h2>Methodology</h2><br>
<h3>Survey Preparation: </h3><br>
A survey was prepared and data was collected using Google Forms. The form comprised of varying questions providing detailed explanation of packaging choices. The survey questions did not oversee basic information. Starting from standard questions such as age, income, and gender to detailed and focused questions like the preference of packaging materials, aesthetic and environmental factors, QR code, colour coded ingredients stripes and tamper evidence were covered. Avoiding a long survey and fatigue, only 20 short questions were asked. A person could finish the survey within 5 minutes. <br>

<h3>Data Collection:</h3><br>
The entire data was collected within a week. There were over 200 responses recorded of ages varying in the range of 16-56 years old. The median age was 21 and average was 25. The median income was 80,000 and the average being 1.9 lakhs. However, the raw data had few null values and repetitions. <br>
<h3>Data processing:</h3><br>
Data was converted into a CSV file and analyzed on a jupyter notebook using Python. There were various data analysis tools used such as NumPy, pandas, Plotly, matplotlib, and chart studio. Now since the project contains different types of graphs and different aspects of it have been explored, so different type of data pre-processing has been done before plotting the respective graphs, which could be making of a new column or a new dataframe itself. Missing values were removed and anomalies were taken care of. Post data cleaning, further processing included Descriptive Analysis and EDA. For easier and faster analysis, all the columns were renamed and a new schema was created.  <br>
<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis</h3><br>
Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach/philosophy for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques (mostly graphical) to <br>
1.	maximize insight into a data set <br>
2.	uncover underlying structure<br>
3.	extract important variables<br>
4.	detect outliers and anomalies<br>
5.	test underlying assumptions<br>
6.	develop parsimonious models<br>
7.	determine optimal factor settings.<br>
<h3>Descriptive analysis</h3><br>
Descriptive statistics is the term given to the analysis of data that helps describe, show or summarize data in a meaningful way such that, for example, patterns might emerge from the data. Descriptive statistics do not, however, allow us to make conclusions beyond the data we have analysed or reach conclusions regarding any hypotheses we might have made. They are simply a way to describe our data.<br>
Descriptive statistics are very important because if we simply presented our raw data it would be hard to visualize what the data was showing, especially if there was a lot of it. Descriptive statistics therefore enables us to present the data in a more meaningful way, which allows simpler interpretation of the data. <br>
